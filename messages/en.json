The lowest point is Lake Chad, a basin fed by the floodplains of the Chari and Logone rivers.",

        "item1": "The first population census took place in 1993. It estimated the total population of Chad at 6,280,000 individuals, of whom 5.7% were nomads (in the strict sense), the remainder being sedentary, semi-sedentary or transhumant. The second census in Chad's history, the most recent, was carried out more than fifteen years later, in 2009. Here are some key figures from this enumeration: the total population is 11.03 million inhabitants (it is estimated at 12.8 million in 2016), of whom 50.6% are under 15 years old and 50.7% are women. The urban population is 22%, making Chad a predominantly rural country. This census highlights the very unequal geographical distribution of the population, with more than half concentrated in the southernmost 10% of the country. Thus, in Chad there are enormous density disparities, ranging from 52.4 inhabitants/km² in Western Logone to 0.1 inhabitants/km² in the Borkou, Ennedi and Tibesti regions, where the population barely exceeds 300,000 individuals in the three regions combined; it is worth noting the extreme disparity between N'Djamena, with nearly 1 million inhabitants, and the Tibesti region, with 25,000 inhabitants!",
        "item2": "The most densely populated regions are Eastern Logone and Western Logone, Mayo Kebbi East and West and Tandjilé, all located in the southwest, and Ouaddaï (721,000 inhabitants) in the east of the country. The Chadian population is young (half are under 15), poorly educated (illiteracy rate of 65%, schooling rate of 75% in the South, against less than 8% in the North). It subsists thanks to agriculture (83% of the active population depends on the primary sector). Living conditions are precarious: 88.6% of homes are still built with traditional materials, 76.4% of inhabitants consume unsafe water (pond or undeveloped well); 79% of Chadians do not use latrines, 1% of households have access to electricity, and 99.5% only use wood or charcoal as an energy source for cooking food.",
        "item3": "Furthermore, Chad, due to its geographical location, is a true crossroads between the Arab world and the sub-Saharan world. Ancestral trans-Saharan trade relations, successive waves of migration of populations from the north and east, the rivalries that followed with indigenous peoples and traditional slave raids have led these two worlds to coexist and intermingle, in a mix of colors and features, customs and religions. Chad is therefore a true ethnic kaleidoscope. When in 1968 the project of a linguistic map of the Atlas of Chad was presented to the Minister of National Education, he examined it at length before sighing: “And to think that we must make a nation out of it!”."

    "texte": "The Republic of Chad, the country of Toumaï, occupies a special place in the heart of the African continent due to its strategic geographical position. The country, after a successful three-year political transition under the leadership of Marshal of Chad, Mahamat Idriss DEBY ITNO, President of the Republic, Head of State, is making giant strides towards its economic take-off. The Head of State's political program is structured around twelve projects, each comprising several actions, including peace, national security, and the promotion of a supportive state. The development program entitled \"Vision 2030, the Chad we want,\" based on the African Union's Agenda 2063 and the United Nations' Agenda 2030, promulgated by the Heads of State of the African Union member states, is currently being implemented. This program, based on pragmatic execution, aims to make Chad an emerging country by 2030. The Embassy of Chad in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire has jurisdiction over four other countries, namely Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. The main objectives of the mission are to maintain and strengthen diplomatic relations between Chad and these five countries. This all-encompassing diplomacy embraces fields as varied as economy, culture, and everything that modern cooperation involves between peace-loving countries that share common interests. The mission of the High Representation of Chad in Côte d'Ivoire also consists of protecting the interests of its community in the five countries under its jurisdiction, in accordance with diplomatic practices. The platform offered to you is a unique and effective reference for obtaining general information about Chad, to effectively promote trade, investment, tourism, and culture. The entire team of the Embassy will always be at your disposal to offer you a warm welcome, not only to Chadians but also to all those from other countries who wish to have essential information on the services we offer, including the issuance of visas and other administrative documents (consular card, birth certificate, marriage, and death certificates). While awaiting a physical visit that we hope will be soon, welcome to \"Virtual Chad.\"",
