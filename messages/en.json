    "texte": "The Republic of Chad, the land of Toumaï, thanks to its strategic geographical position, occupies a privileged place at the heart of the African continent. The country, after a successful political transition in three years under the leadership of the Marshal of Chad, Mahamat Idriss DEBY ITNO, President of the Republic, Head of State, is taking giant steps toward economic take-off. The political program of the Head of State is structured around twelve projects, each comprising several actions, notably peace, national security, and the promotion of a united State. The development program entitled \"Vision 2030, the Chad We Want,\" aligned with the African Union Agenda 2063 and the United Nations Agenda 2030, promulgated by the Heads of State of the African Union, is underway. This program, based on pragmatic execution, aims to make Chad an emerging country by 2030. The Embassy of Chad in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire has jurisdiction in four other countries, namely Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. The main objectives of the mission are to maintain and strengthen diplomatic relations between Chad and these five countries. This all-encompassing diplomacy embraces areas as diverse as the economy, culture, and all that modern cooperation between peace-loving countries with shared common interests entails. The mission of the High Representation of Chad in Côte d'Ivoire also consists in protecting the interests of its community in the five countries under its jurisdiction, in accordance with diplomatic practices. The platform offered to you constitutes a unique and effective reference for obtaining general information about Chad, in order to effectively promote trade, investment, tourism, and culture. The entire Embassy team will always be at your disposal to give you a warm welcome, not only to Chadians but also to all those from other countries who wish to obtain essential information about the services we offer, in particular the issuance of visas and other administrative documents (consular card, birth certificate, marriage and death certificate). While awaiting a physical visit that we hope will be soon, welcome to the \"Virtual Chad.\"",

        "item1": "The first population census took place in 1993. It estimated the total population of Chad at 6,280,000 individuals, of whom 5.7% were nomads (in the strict sense), the rest being sedentary, semi-sedentary or transhumant. The second census in Chad's history, the most recent one, was carried out more than fifteen years later, in 2009. Here are some key data from this count: the total population is 11.03 million inhabitants (estimated at 12.8 million in 2016), of which 50.6% are under 15 years old and 50.7% are women. The urban population is 22%, making Chad a predominantly rural country. This census highlights the very unequal geographical distribution of the population, with more than half concentrated in the 10% of the country located in the south. Thus, in Chad there are enormous density disparities, ranging from 52.4 inhab/km² in West Logone to 0.1 inhab/km² in the regions of Borkou, Ennedi and Tibesti, where the population barely exceeds 300,000 individuals in the three regions combined; to note the extreme disparity between N'Djamena, with nearly 1 million inhabitants, and the Tibesti region, with 25,000 inhabitants!",
        "item2": "The most densely populated regions are East Logone and West Logone, East and West Mayo Kebbi, and Tandjilé, all located in the southwest, and Ouaddaï (721,000 inhabitants) in the east of the country. The Chadian population is young (half are under 15), poorly educated (literacy rate of 65%, school enrollment rate of 75% in the South, compared to less than 8% in the North). It subsists thanks to agriculture (83% of the active population depends on the primary sector). Living conditions are precarious: 88.6% of homes are still built with traditional materials, 76.4% of inhabitants consume unsafe water (puddle or undeveloped well); 79% of Chadians do not use latrines, 1% of households have access to electricity, and 99.5% only use wood or charcoal as an energy source for cooking food.",
        "item3": "Furthermore, Chad, due to its geographical location, is a true crossroads between the Arab world and the sub-Saharan world. The ancestral relations of trans-Saharan trade, the successive waves of migration of populations from the north and east, the rivalries that followed with indigenous peoples and the traditional slave raids led these two worlds to rub shoulders and intermingle, in a mixture of colors and features, customs and religions. Chad is therefore a true ethnic kaleidoscope. When in 1968 the project for a linguistic map of the Atlas of Chad was presented to the Minister of National Education, he examined it at length before sighing: “And to think that we have to make a nation out of it!”"
