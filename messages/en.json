    "texte": "The Republic of Chad, the land of Toumaï, due to its strategic geographical position, holds a privileged place at the heart of the African continent. After a successful political transition lasting three years, under the leadership of the Marshal of Chad, Mahamat Idriss DEBY ITNO, President of the Republic and Head of State, the country is taking giant steps toward its economic takeoff. The political program of the Head of State is structured around twelve major projects, each comprising several actions, notably peace, national security, and the promotion of a united state.\n\nThe development program entitled \"Vision 2030, the Chad We Want,\" based on the African Union's Agenda 2063 and the United Nations' 2030 Agenda promulgated by the Heads of State of the African Union member countries, is currently being implemented. This program, based on pragmatic execution, aims to make Chad an emerging country by 2030.\n\nThe Embassy of Chad in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire has jurisdiction over four other countries: Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. The main objectives of the mission are the maintenance and strengthening of diplomatic relations between Chad and these five countries. This all-encompassing diplomacy covers diverse fields such as the economy, culture, and all aspects of modern cooperation between peace-loving countries sharing common interests.\n\nThe mission of Chad's High Representation in Côte d'Ivoire also includes protecting the interests of its community in the five countries under its jurisdiction, in accordance with diplomatic customs.\n\nThe platform offered to you constitutes a unique and effective reference for obtaining general information about Chad, in order to efficiently promote trade, investment, tourism, and culture.\n\nThe entire Embassy team is always at your disposal to provide a warm welcome, not only to Chadians but also to everyone from other countries who wish to obtain essential information about the services we offer, notably visa issuance and other administrative documents (consular cards, birth certificates, marriage and death certificates).\n\nWhile awaiting a physical visit, which we hope will be soon, you are welcome to the \"Virtual Chad.\"",

        "item1": "The first population census took place in 1993. It estimated Chad's total population at 6,280,000 individuals, of whom 5.7% were nomads (in the strict sense), the rest being sedentary, semi-sedentary, or transhumant. The second census in Chad's history, the most recent, was conducted more than fifteen years later, in 2009. Here are some key figures from this count: the total population stands at 11.03 million inhabitants (estimated at 12.8 million in 2016), with 50.6% under 15 years old and 50.7% women. The urban population is 22%, making Chad a predominantly rural country. This census highlights the very unequal geographical distribution of the population, with more than half concentrated in the southernmost 10% of the country. Thus, Chad has enormous density disparities, ranging from 52.4 inhabitants/km² in Logone Occidental to 0.1 inhabitants/km² in the regions of Borkou, Ennedi, and Tibesti, where the population barely exceeds 300,000 individuals in all three regions combined; note the extreme disparity between N'Djamena, nearly 1 million inhabitants, and the Tibesti region, 25,000 inhabitants!",
        "item2": "The most densely populated regions are Logone Oriental and Logone Occidental, Mayo Kebbi East and West, and Tandjilé, all located in the southwest, and Ouaddaï (721,000 inhabitants) in the east of the country. The Chadian population is young (half are under 15), poorly educated (illiteracy rate of 65%, school enrollment rate of 75% in the South, compared to less than 8% in the North). They subsist through agriculture (83% of the active population depends on the primary sector). Living conditions are precarious: 88.6% of homes are still built with traditional materials, 76.4% of inhabitants consume questionable water (pond or unprotected well); 79% of Chadians do not use latrines, 1% of households have access to electricity, and 99.5% rely only on wood or charcoal as a source of energy for cooking.",
        "item3": "Moreover, Chad, due to its geographical location, is a true crossroads between the Arab world and sub-Saharan Africa. The ancestral relations of trans-Saharan trade, successive waves of migration from the north and east, the resulting rivalries with indigenous peoples, and traditional slave raids have led these two worlds to mingle and intermix, in a blend of colors and features, customs and religions. Chad is therefore a true ethnic kaleidoscope. When in 1968 the project for a linguistic map of the Atlas of Chad was presented to the Minister of National Education, he examined it at length before sighing: 'And to think that we have to make a nation out of this!'"
