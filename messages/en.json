        "item1": "The first population census took place in 1993. It estimated the total population of Chad at 6,280,000 individuals, of whom 5.7% were nomads (in the strict sense), the rest being sedentary, semi-sedentary, or transhumant. The second census in Chad's history, the most recent one, was carried out more than fifteen years later, in 2009. Here are some key data from this count: the total population amounts to 11.03 million inhabitants (it is estimated at 12.8 million in 2016), of whom 50.6% are under 15 years old and 50.7% are women. The urban population is 22%, making Chad a predominantly rural country. This census highlights the very uneven geographical distribution of the population, with more than half concentrated in the southernmost 10% of the country. Thus, in Chad, there are enormous disparities in density, ranging from 52.4 inhab/km² in Western Logone to 0.1 inhab/km² in the Borkou, Ennedi, and Tibesti regions, where the population barely exceeds 300,000 individuals in the three regions combined; to note the extreme disparity between N'Djamena, with nearly 1 million inhabitants, and the Tibesti region, with 25,000 inhabitants!",
        "item2": "The most densely populated regions are Eastern Logone and Western Logone, Mayo Kebbi East and West, and Tandjilé, all located in the southwest, and Ouaddaï (721,000 inhabitants) in the east of the country. The Chadian population is young (half are under 15), poorly educated (illiteracy rate of 65%, school enrollment rate of 75% in the South, compared to less than 8% in the North). They subsist thanks to agriculture (83% of the active population depends on the primary sector). Living conditions are precarious: 88.6% of homes are still built with traditional materials, 76.4% of inhabitants consume questionable water (puddle or undeveloped well); 79% of Chadians do not use latrines, 1% of households have access to electricity, and 99.5% only use wood or charcoal as a source of energy for cooking food.",
        "item3": "Moreover, Chad, due to its geographical location, is a true crossroads between the Arab world and the sub-Saharan world. The ancestral relations of trans-Saharan trade, the successive waves of migration of populations from the north and east, the rivalries that followed with the indigenous peoples, and the traditional slave raids have led these two worlds to rub shoulders and interbreed, in a mixture of colors and features, customs, and religions. Chad is therefore a true ethnic kaleidoscope. When in 1968 the project for a linguistic map of the Chad Atlas was presented to the Minister of National Education, he examined it for a long time before sighing: 'And to think that we have to make it a nation!'"

    "texte": "The Republic of Chad, land of Toumaï, due to its strategic geographical position, occupies a prominent place in the heart of the African continent. The country, after a successful political transition of three years under the leadership of the Marshal of Chad, Mahamat Idriss DEBY ITNO, President of the Republic, Head of State, is taking giant steps for its economic takeoff. The political program of the Head of State is structured around twelve projects, each including several actions, notably peace, national security, and the promotion of a solidarity-based state. The development program entitled \"Vision 2030, the Chad we want,\" based on the African Union's 2063 agenda and the United Nations' 2030 agenda, promulgated by the Heads of State of the African Union member states, is being implemented. This program, based on a pragmatic execution, aims to make Chad an emerging country by 2030. The Embassy of Chad in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire has jurisdiction over four other countries, namely Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. The main objectives of the mission are to maintain and strengthen diplomatic relations between Chad and these five countries. This all-out diplomacy embraces areas as varied as the economy, culture, and all that modern cooperation entails between peace-loving countries that share common interests. The mission of the High Representation of Chad in Côte d'Ivoire also consists of protecting the interests of its community in the five countries of its jurisdiction, in accordance with diplomatic practices. The platform offered to you is a unique and effective reference for obtaining general information about Chad, in order to effectively promote trade, investments, tourism, and culture. The entire Embassy team will always be at your disposal to offer you a warm welcome, not only to Chadians but to all those from other countries who wish to have essential information on the services we offer, including the issuance of visas and other administrative documents (consular card, birth certificate, marriage and death certificate). While waiting for a physical visit that we hope will be soon, welcome to \"Virtual Chad.\"",
